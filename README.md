### Hola! ğŸ‘‹

I'm Clary, a PhD candidate in chemical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I use data science and satistical tools to understand the dynamics of multi-particle systems (currently soft "squishy" materials ğŸ”¬ and stock market indexes ğŸ“ˆ).

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Tableau, which are tools that I did not get exposed to during my engineering studies.
